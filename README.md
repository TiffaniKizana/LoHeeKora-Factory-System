# LoHeeKora-Factory-System
This project aims to help the employee of a factory company manage the goods and the employee in the factory. They can add, update, or delete the raw goods or the finished goods. They can also insert, update, or delete the employee data based on the type of employment (fulltime, part-time, internship).

In this project, I use Java 7 as the base language and Eclipse as the IDE to build the app.
